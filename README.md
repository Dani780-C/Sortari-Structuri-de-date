# Sorting Algorithms // C++

In main file are five algorithms of sorting numbers:

- InsertionSort
- CountSort
- MergeSort
- QuickSort
- RadixSort

The algorithms are designed for sorting arrays of randomly generated numbers, almost sorted numbers(ascending and descending), constant numbers and real numbers(exception for real numbers -> RadixSort).

*Once you run the code, you will receive the waiting time for sorting different automatically generated arrays.*
